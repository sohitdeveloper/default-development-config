// Change terminal color

1. Click ctrl+shift+P and then search and Open User Setting (JSON)

2. Paste the JSON settings below to change basic colors

"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
   "terminal.background": "#2C3E50",
   "terminal.foreground": "#E0E0E0",
 }
For a higher level of colour customizations, you can use this Terminal Colors Generator. It will create JSON with all colours you selected and just paste it into your settings JSON.
